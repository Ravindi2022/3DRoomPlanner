# 3DRoomPlanner
3DRoomPlanner is an interactive furniture design and visualization application that allows users to place, arrange and customize furniture in a 3D room environment. Designed for interior designers and end-users alike, the app lets you pick room dimensions, tweak color schemes for walls and furnishings, and see a realistic, real-time preview of your space. Under the hood it’s built with React and powered by the three.js library for high-performance 3D rendering.

In addition, a companion furniture store website named LUXE showcases the studio’s features and guides users through installation and usage. That website is built with Vite, React and TypeScript.

This project was developed as part of the PUSL3122 module: Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics, and Visualisation, as a group coursework assignment for the academic year 2024–2025.
